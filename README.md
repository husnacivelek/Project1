*This was my first project for Data Structures And Algorithms lecture in university. The explanation made was as follows:


**Problem 1: Loose the letter and table**

  1. N people are sitting around a table to play a game. Each of these people has a name. On each turn,
     a random number k [1<=k<=N] is chosen. The kth person loses one letter* from his/her name. 
     If a person has no letters left in his/her name, he/she loses the game, and will be removed from 
     the table. The last person who is still in the table, wins the game. 
     
        a. You will implement circular linked list based program to simulate this scenario. 
        
        b. The names are chosen randomly from the class.txt. Use only the first names. If you like,
           you can limit the characters in a name with 5 or 6 to give equal chance to all names. 
           
        c. Your program must display the value of k in each turn, the selected student, and the 
           whole list of names (put an indicator to one who just lost a letter from his/her name)
           
        d. At the end, program displays the winner. 
        
*You can use all String and File (Scanner) library functions.* 


**Problem 2: Student message transfer line**

  2. Each student in a line can pass a message (a string) to any other student after him/her. When a 
     message request arrives to the first student (source), it can pass the message to other two /three 
     students that are placed in the kth position next/previous to him/her. Each non-source student 
     in the message line can only pass the message one step forward/backward. However, if the message 
     arrives at a hub-student, he-she can reset the reach of the message to k students. Hub-students do 
     not extend every message they receive; instead, they extend only the messages they are interested 
     in. They are interested in messages which contain at least 2 letters of their names. If at least 2 
     letters in the message and their names match, they give a boost to the message, i.e., re-initiate the 
     message line. You will write a program to simulate this scenario where the student message line is 
     modelled as a doubly linked list. You must create appropriate container (Node) class to include 
     Students. 
     
     
a) The list is generated randomly with 30 students. 

b) Names should be chosen randomly from a txt file, e.g. class.txt

c) M students will be chosen randomly as hub-student. 

d) The client chooses a name from the list and sends a String message.

e) The direction of message transfer is selected randomly either as forward or backwards at the source 
student (node). Once the direction is set, it does not change until message arrives to the final 
student.

f) The message can be passed to at most k students linked to these students. 

g) If one of the k students is a hub and the message has at least two letters in common with his/her 
name, he/she extends the message to other k students in forward or backwards directions.
